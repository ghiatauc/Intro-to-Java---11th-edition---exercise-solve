- <b>About book</b><br>
Designed to support an introductory programming course,Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures teaches concepts of problem-solving and object-orientated programming using a fundamentals-first approach. Beginner programmers learn critical problem-solving techniques then move on to grasp the key concepts of object-oriented, GUI programming, advanced GUI and Web programming using JavaFX. This course approaches Java GUI programming using JavaFX, which has replaced Swing as the new GUI tool for developing cross-platform-rich Internet applications and is simpler to learn and use. The 11th edition has been completely revised to enhance clarity and presentation, and includes new and expanded content, examples, and exercises.

/*
(Science: day of the week)
Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is 
				h = (q + (26 * (m + 1) / 10) + k + (k / 4) + (j / 4) + (5 * j)) % 7;
where 
h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, and 6: Friday). 
q is the day of the month. 
m is the month (3: March, 4: April, . . ., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. 
j is year / 100 
k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100)
